Decsription of JT65-HF main loop control structure.

JT65-HF uses a time synchronous loop to control program operation plus a number of asynchronous
events that service the GUI.  The difficult part of this is to sperate the sync and async portions
of the code.  At the present time the code is so mixed up that it becomes increasingly difficult
to keep track of things that need to be handled in the sync realm and those that run in the async
realm.

Compounding this is that I really didn't understand many of the finer points of programming a
program of this complexity when I began.  Now, some three years later, I would hope, I have a better
understanding of the needs of JT65-HF and some of the more intricate portions of programming something
like this in FPC/Lazarus.
