Change log

For 2.0.0

Converted configuration data structure to class (object) implementation.

Added DDE Class to facilitate DDE communication.  This will be of use to rig control
and logging programs.

Added Rig Controller class to act as a common interface to various physical rig
controller methods.  This allows the main program to interface with all supported
rig controllers using the same code.

Added class encapsulating physical rig control methods used by DX Lab CI-V Commander.
Commander is now read from rig and write to rig versus read only.

Added class encapsulating physical rig control methods used by Ham Radio Deluxe (DDE Interface).

Added class encapsulating physical rig control methods used by OmniRig.
So far, OmniRig is still read only.

Added validator class.  Validator class has methods to validate various items used by JT65-HF
such as callsigns, grids, frequencies and free text messages.

New configuration system (guided configuration).  This takes user through all items of
importance in a step by step process with full validation of input values.  No more bad
callsigns or grids is the goal.



More on the class (or object) structures.

Rig Control:

The common class is rigobject.  Class rigobject provides all the data structures related
to rig control in a common interface.  The class uses the following rig control method
specific classes:  civobject for CI-V Commander (DX Labs), ddehrdobject for HRD,
omnirig object for OmniRig and si570 object for DG8SAQ Si570 USB controller.  Now the
main code only has to communicate with rigobject using the same methods/variables
regardless of actual rig control method used.

Configuration:

The common class is cfgobject.  Class cfgobject holds all user configurable variables
during the program's run and all data contained in the structure is validated for full
conformance with JT65 protocol requirements.  No more bad calls/grids/QRGs.  Beyond
that the class is, at program start, assinged twice with the second acting as a
'shadow' copy allowing for an undo of changes to configuration.
